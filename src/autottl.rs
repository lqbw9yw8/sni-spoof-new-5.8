//! autottl — learn the decoy TTL from the inbound hop count. [DONE]
//!
//! A TTL-limited decoy must travel far enough to reach the *in-line DPI*
//! box but die before the real origin replies. The safest first guess is the
//! number of IP hops to the destination, derived from the **inbound**
//! packet's remaining TTL: on a typical Ethernet path the client's SYN
//! leaves with a well-known initial TTL (64/128/255), so the hop count to
//! this host is `initial_ttl - observed_ttl`. We then emit the decoy with
//! that many hops of headroom (plus a small `delta`), so it reaches the DPI
//! but expires one hop past it.
//!
//! The learned value is a *hint*: the operator's `decoy_ttl` setting is the
//! hard ceiling, and we never raise TTL above 64 (the protocol's common
//! inner value). This module is pure logic + in-memory state, so it is unit
//! tested on every OS.

/// there is little room between "reaches the DPI" and "reaches the origin",

/// closer than the origin, so a larger margin is both safe and more likely
/// to die before the far end.

/// * `a1` — reduction on the shortest paths (floored at 1).
/// * `a2` — reduction at/after `m` hops (raised to at least `a1`).
/// * `m`  — distance at which the reduction saturates, and the ceiling on
///   the returned TTL.
///
/// ## Previous behaviour (fixed)
///
/// The scale used to be inverted — `hops <= a2` took a reduction of
/// `a2 - 1` while distant paths took only `a1` — so with the shipped
/// defaults (`a1 = 0`, `a2 = 4`, `m = 10`) every path of four hops or
/// fewer produced `hops - 3` floored at 1, i.e. **TTL 1**. A TTL-1 decoy
/// is discarded by the first router and never reaches any DPI, silently
/// disabling the technique on exactly the short paths it was meant to
/// cover. It also had no test; the ones below pin the shape of the curve.
