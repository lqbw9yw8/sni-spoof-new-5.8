//! patterniha's Python relay and `dpi_guard` must not run at the same time
//! (both would open WinDivert and both would try to bind 127.0.0.1:40443),
//! and two copies of `dpi_guard` must not race over the same capture handle.
//! `acquire()` creates an exclusive file lock on `dpi_guard.instance.lock`
//! **in the directory of the running executable** (never cwd) and keeps it
//! until the process exits or the guard drops.

//! * Unix: `flock(LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB)` on an open fd.
//! * Windows: `CreateFileW` with `dwShareMode = 0` — a second opener gets
//!   `ERROR_SHARING_VIOLATION`.
//!
//! The crate is `#![deny(unsafe_code)]`; this module opts back in because
//! both platform locks are FFI calls. The unsafe blocks are tiny, each
//! documented with its exact safety invariant.
