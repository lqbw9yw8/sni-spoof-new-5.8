//! Bounded retirement policy for WinDivert driver handles. [DONE]
//!
//! Pure logic, cfg-free, so the policy is compiled and unit tested on every
//! OS. `engine.rs` (Windows-only) applies it to the retired-handle list.
//!
//! ## Why handles are parked at all
//!
//! The live capture handle is published through a raw `AtomicPtr` so that
//! `WinDivertShutdown` can run concurrent with a blocking `recv` (documented
//! as safe by the C API). Any thread that loaded the old pointer may still
//! be inside `send`/`shutdown` on it, so a retired handle cannot be closed
//! (dropped) at retirement time — that would free the `WinDivert` struct
//! under an in-flight FFI call (use-after-free).
//!
//! ## How the leak is bounded instead
//!
//! 1. Every retired handle is shut down immediately (its `recv` unblocks),
//!    then parked with a retirement timestamp.
//! 2. On every retirement the list is swept: entries older than
//!    [`RETIRED_GRACE`] are closed (dropped) from the oldest end. A thread
//!    that observed the pointer before the swap completes its short FFI
//!    call within microseconds; a 30 s grace is six orders of magnitude of
//!    margin.
//! 3. Hard bound: the list is never allowed to exceed [`RETIRED_CAP`]
//!    entries. If more than `cap` entries are still inside the grace
//!    window (only possible with pathological filter-reload flapping),
//!    the oldest entries are force-closed anyway — a bounded, rare, logged
//!    event that is strictly better than an unbounded kernel-handle leak.
//!    Even in this path nothing panics and the packet path is unaffected:
//!    the capture loop only ever sends on the *current* handle, and
//!    `reinject_held_packets` falls back to the send-only inject handle if
//!    a send on a closed handle errors.
